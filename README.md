# Real Time Search

> The Real-Time Search Rails project allows users to search for different articles by title and receive search results. Additionally, it provides analytics for users, revealing information such as the user's query, IP address, country, operating system, and timestamp. If the user's search does not match any titles, no information is recorded. 


## Built With :hammer_and_wrench: 

- **Ruby:** Popular programming language that’s used for lots of things, from web app development to data analysis.

- **Rails:**  Full-stack framework. It ships with all the tools needed to build amazing web apps on both the front and back end.

- **GitHub flow:**  Correct use of Branches for deployment and features development.

- **Linters Check (Rubocop):** Local and Pull Request check for errors, bugs and stylistic errors in code.

- **RSpec:** Unit test framework for the Ruby programming language.

- **Sqlite3:** powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
